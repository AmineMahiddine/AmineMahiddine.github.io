*responsive modern portfolio*
i've always belived that you'll never improve your self inless you start creating something, that's why i decided to 
create this earlly staged porfolio, that will contain most of my future projects. i've start this project by prototyping and design. beying my firt sirious project i've find my self lost, but day after day i start having an idea on waht i'm doing, and i learned about some great designer resources that inspired me (  [Undraw](https://undraw.co/illustrations) ,  [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/),  [Behance](https://www.behance.net/)). during the developement phase i've gain somme greate exeperiences, faceing somme problems every developer have to face at some point, from cleanning up the code, making it erors free Accessible for every user (screen readers ...), hosting the web site and getting an SSL certificate ..., the website will be much butter and richer with content as i get advanced in my carrier so stay tooned !!
